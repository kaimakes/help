    <h2>Linux Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <p>Here are some useful Linux commands and snippets I've picked up:</p>
    <pre>

🌍 Navigating the Jungle:

    cd [directory] – move to your new home, because who doesn't love a change of scenery?
    ls – list all the treasures hidden in this folder (and maybe a few socks you lost).
    pwd – remind yourself where you are, in case you get lost!

⚙️ Permissions, but make it flashy:

    chmod +x [file] – give your file the power of eXecution! Watch out, it's executable now!
    sudo – summon the powers of the all-seeing, all-knowing superuser. Use wisely!

📦 Git-ing it together:

    git init – start the beginning of your code empire!
    git status – check your progress, like looking in a mirror before going out.
    git add . – add everything to your party bus of changes.
    git commit -m "message" – tell the world what you just accomplished! (Don't forget the cool message!)

🧙‍♂️ NVM Sorcery:

    source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh – call upon the powers of node version magic!
    nvm install [version] – install a shiny new version of Node.js like a true wizard.
    nvm use [version] – switch to your chosen node version, because you’re fancy like that.

🚀 Astro Commands (reaching for the stars):

    npm create astro@latest – blast off your new Astro project into the code galaxy.
    npm run dev – let your local server shine bright like a star!

🔄 Staying Updated:

    sudo apt update – give your system a coffee break and check for the latest updates.
    sudo apt upgrade – level up your system’s superpowers to the latest version!

🔌 Power Moves:

    sudo reboot – give your system a refreshing nap... it’ll wake up energized!

🔍 Finding Stuff (without asking the internet, promise):

    which [command] – find out where the command is hiding, like a detective.
    apt search [app] – hunt down cool apps like a treasure hunter (no whip required).
    sudo apt install [app] – install apps like a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat!

📚 Quick Tips:

    Always use sudo with caution! It’s like having the keys to the castle—don’t leave the drawbridge down.
    man [command] – read the manual if you're lost... or if you're just feeling extra geeky
